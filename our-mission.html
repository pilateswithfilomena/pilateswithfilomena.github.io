      <p>
        I take a holistic, evidence-informed approach to fitness, combining classical and contemporary Pilates with
        functional training, calisthenics, and movement education. My goal is to help you become stronger, and confident
        in understanding and working with your body. Instead of training muscles in isolation, I develop integrated
        movement patterns that build mobility, functional strength, and ease — reducing pain and stiffness.
      </p>
      <p>
        My mission is to help you build a strong movement foundation through guided practice and science-based
        education. The way we train our bodies deeply influences how we manage stress, emotions, and mindset. By
        consistently developing skeletal muscle, we can prevent or manage issues such as sarcopenia, muscle imbalances,
        and physiological atrophy — supporting rehabilitation, post-rehabilitation progress, and long-term movement
        freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am especially committed to raising awareness among women, who on average have lower muscle mass and often work
        in roles that demand repetitive movement or prolonged postures (office, dentists, hairdressers, etc.). Without
        support, these factors can undermine comfort, participation in work, and quality of life — effects felt most in
        lower-income communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through personalized coaching and Pilates-based education, I provide practical strategies to prevent posture-
        and skeletal muscle-related issues, manage symptoms, and build independence for long term better health and a
        higher quality of life.
