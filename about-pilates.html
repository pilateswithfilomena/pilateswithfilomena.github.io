      <h1 class="secondary-title">About Pilates</h1>
      <h2 class="secondary-sub-title">What is Pilates and why should I be doing it?</h2>

      <p>
        Pilates is a holistic exercise system created by Joseph Pilates in the 1920s. It's known as a form of low-impact
        strength training that focuses on alignment, posture, core strength, and stability. It helps improve overall
        muscle tone, endurance, flexibility, mobility, and balance. Pilates utilizes both bodyweight and light
        resistance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pilates can be used both for recovery and prevention, helping you feel more comfortable and confident in your
        body.
      </p>
      <p>
        In recovery, Pilates is well-known for its therapeutic benefits, particularly for musculoskeletal conditions
        like muscle imbalances, injury recovery, and general back, neck, and shoulder pain, including piriformis
        syndrome (just to name a few). This is why it's widely prescribed by physicians and used by physiotherapists.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consistent Pilates practice can reduce or eliminate back pain and poor posture, often experienced by office
        workers, hairdressers, and professionals with repetitive or poor movement patterns. It also benefits elite
        athletes by enhancing flexibility and precise movement, preventing injuries. Additionally, it improves
        coordination, balance and proprioception, reducing fall risk for those with balance issues due to aging or other
        reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pilates is a valuable addition to any holistic fitness and well-being routine. As Joseph Pilates stated:
        "physical fitness is the first requisite of happiness".
      </p>

      <h2 class="secondary-sub-title">How many times should I practice Pilates?</h2>

      <p>
        To see results, you should practice Pilates at least 2 to 3 times a week. Depending on your fitness routine and
        goals, this can include group or private classes, with a customized program to ensure your specific objectives
        are met.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a rehabilitation setting, the frequency can range from twice a week to every other day, or even daily (with a
        rest day), depending on the type of injury or condition you are recovering from.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beginners and early intermediate students should avoid self-practice due to the complex movement patterns and
        exercise form, which can lead to injuries or ineffective results if performed incorrectly. A certified Pilates
        instructor will teach you the right breathing and associated movement patterns, as well as how to recruit the
        right muscles for each exercise. You will also benefit from their knowledge in adjusting the exercises to match
        your fitness level.
