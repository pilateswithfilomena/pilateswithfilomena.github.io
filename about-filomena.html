      <p>
        My name is Filomena, I am a certified Pilates Instructor. I am a former
        architect and PhD in the fields of Project Development and
        Sustainability.
      </p>
      <p>
        My passion for Pilates and holistic wellness began over two years ago.
        By the end of 2022, I started to suffer from acute back pain, which
        rapidly spread to my neck, shoulders, and torso. This was followed by
        intense muscle spasms, a gradual loss of strength, and severe stiffness.
        In early 2023, I was diagnosed with head-to-toe hypotonia and
        hypotrophy, radiating into my limbs. My body felt like a prison.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started an intensive physical therapy treatment, which later included
        Pilates. This was a game-changer! Month after month, I regained a little
        more independence. I was able to make my own bed without spasms, drive
        again, vacuum, and eventually go for long walks and to the supermarket.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pilates helped me regain strength and rebalance my muscles. At the
        clinic, I trained with apparatus (reformer, Cadillac, chair, and
        barrel), which I didn't have access to at home. It was also the first
        time I designed my own rehabilitation mat-based Pilates routine, which I
        unknowingly followed consistently every day for nearly two years to
        complement and accelerate my recovery.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the help of doctors and physiotherapists, I educated myself about
        muscle conditions, causes, treatments, biomechanics, and anatomy. Later,
        I decided to pursue formal education in the Classical Pilates method to
        help others prevent and recover from these and other conditions that can
        drastically impact lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        My formal education through courses and Continuing Professional
        Development is ongoing, as is my passion for sharing my story and
        raising awareness about muscle loss and its devastating consequences
        among women, the most affected group, especially as we age. Currently, I
        still follow a Pilates routine that I complement with hypertrophy
        training to minimize muscle loss and improve muscle development and
        quality.
