      </div>
      <p>
        My name is Filomena, and I am a certified Pilates Instructor (Traditional Pilates, L3 Mat Pilates, Standing
        Pilates, Functional Reformer) YMCA and CIMSPA approved. I am also a former architect and hold a PhD in Project
        Development and Sustainability.
      </p>
      <p>
        My passion for Pilates and holistic fitness began in 2023, as I combined physical, mental, and emotional
        training to overcome physiological muscle atrophy. By late 2022, I began suffering from acute back pain that
        rapidly spread to my neck, shoulders, and torso. This was followed by intense muscle spasms, a gradual loss of
        strength, and severe stiffness. In early 2023, I was diagnosed with full-body hypotonia and hypotrophy,
        radiating into my limbs. My body felt like a prison.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started an intensive physical therapy treatment, which later included Pilates. This was a game-changer! Month
        after month, I regained a little more independence. I was able to make my own bed without spasms, drive again,
        vacuum, and eventually go for long walks and to the supermarket.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pilates helped me regain strength and rebalance my muscles. At the clinic, I trained with apparatus (reformer,
        Cadillac, chair, and barrel), which I didn't have access to at home. It was also the first time I designed my
        own rehabilitation mat-based Pilates routine, which I unknowingly followed consistently every day for nearly two
        years to complement and accelerate my recovery.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the help of doctors and physiotherapists, I educated myself about muscle conditions, causes, treatments,
        biomechanics, and anatomy. Later, I decided to pursue formal education in the Classical Pilates method to help
        others prevent and recover from these and other conditions that can drastically impact lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        My formal education through courses and Continuing Professional Development is ongoing, as is my passion for
        sharing my story and raising awareness about muscle loss and its devastating consequences among women, the most
        affected group, especially as we age. Currently, I still follow a Pilates routine that I complement with
        hypertrophy training to minimize muscle loss and improve muscle development and quality.
